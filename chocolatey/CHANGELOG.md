##0.9.8.3 (July 7, 2011)

**BREAKING CHANGES:**

 * Chocolatey no longer runs the entire powershell script as an administrator. With the addition of the Start-ChocolateyProcessAsAdmin, this is how you will get to administrative tasks outside of the helpers.

FEATURES:

 * New chocolatey command! InstallMissing allows you to install a package only if it is not already installed. Shortcut is 'cinstm'.
 * New Helper! Install-ChocolateyPath - give it a path for out of band items that are not imported to path with chocolatey
 * New Helper! Start-ChocolateyProcessAsAdmin - this allows you to run processes as administrator
 * New Helper! Install-ChocolateyDesktopLink - put shortcuts on the desktop

IMPROVEMENTS:

 * NuGet updated to v1.4
 * Much of the error handling is improved. There are two new Helpers to call (ChocolateySuccess and Write-ChocolateyFailure).
 * Chocolatey no longer needs administrative rights to install itself.

##0.9.8.2 (May 21, 2011)

BUG FIXES:

 * General fix to bad character in file. Fixed selection for update as well.

##0.9.8 (May 4, 2011)

**BREAKING CHANGES:**

 * A dependency will not reinstall once it has been installed. To have it reinstall, you can install it directly (or delete it from the repository and run the core package).

IMPROVEMENTS:

 * Shortcuts have been added: 'cup' for 'chocolatey update', 'cver' for 'chocolatey version', and 'clist' for 'chocolatey list'.
 * Update only runs if newer version detected.
 * Calling update with no arguments will update chocolatey.
 * Calling update with all will update your entire chocolatey repository.

 * New chocolatey command! Version allows you to see if a package you have installed is the most up to date. Leave out package and it will check for chocolatey itself.

IMPROVEMENTS:

 * The powershell module is automatically loaded, so packages no longer need to import the module. This means one line chocolateyInstall.ps1 files!
 * Error handling is improved.
 * Silent installer override for msi has been removed to allow for additional arguments that need to be passed.
